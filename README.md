# Comma App

Here are 1,000 trips from the SF Bay Area, each of which is a JSON file containing an array of coordinates and speed sampled at once per second. Build a web or React app containing an interactive map visualizing the distribution of speeds along trips recorded with our dash cam app chffr.
